You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:


* What new skills have you learned?
  
* What has been easy?
  
* What has been difficult?
  
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

My Response to all those questions is as follows:

1.I have learned how to create an HTML page structure with tags and attributes.
Specifically, how to include images with caption, the difference between absolute and relative path, when and how to use captions, horizontal rule, <del> tag, <sup> tag, insert line breaks, semantic difference between <bold> and <strong>tags.

2. The easy part was understanding how HTML works. 

3. A difficult but useful part was learning to research for solution to a problem by using the right keywords.

4. I researched what I wanted to do in HTML and, consequentely, found the tags I needed.
